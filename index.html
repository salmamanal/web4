  <p class="text-muted">At its most basic, Christianity is the faith tradition that focuses on the figure of Jesus Christ.
     In this context, faith refers both to the believers' act of trust and to the content of their faith.
      As a tradition, Christianity is more than a system of religious belief. It also has generated a culture,
       a set of ideas and ways of life, practices, and artifacts that have been handed down from generation to generation since Jesus first became the object of faith. 
       Christianity is thus both a living tradition of faith and the culture that the faith leaves behind.
        The agent of Christianity is the church, the community of people who make up the body of believers.</p>

      <p class="text-muted"> A library is a collection of materials,
        books or media that are accessible for use and not just for display purposes.
        A library provides physical (hard copies) or digital access (soft copies) materials, and may be a physical location or a virtual space, or both.
         A library's collection can include printed materials and other physical resources in many formats 
         such as DVD, CD and cassette as well as access to information, music or other content held on bibliographic databases.</p>

   canteens must be better organised and more efficient than they have been in the past.
   Online menus with photographs of the meals prepared, and detailed descriptions of their ingredients help both students and parents make the right nutritional choices.
    Each student or staff member who accesses the canteen could be provided with a School Canteen Account on the school website that keeps track of their previous meal choices
     and any dietary requirements they may have. Ordering online by ticking a box and paying for meals online can eliminate all the fuss of money handling, making it safer and less 
     complicated for staff and students alike. Here again, diversity is the key.</p>

  <h4>Implemented Online Attendance Management System</h4>

<p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12" >Implemented Online Attendance Management System: This informs parents about their child's/children's activities in the school, instantly. Once a student reaches the school, 
  the parents will be informed about the status via text messages.This helps schools keep a record of the students' absenteeism. Students can mark the attendance by logging in, and this is stored in a database, which can later be checked by 
  the Admin. The tracker has so much potential that it can identify which students are irregular to their classes and not ready to establish connectivity with the actual concepts of their curriculum's subjects.
   As soon as you enter a student's Enrollment Number or Name, details like availability in classes, number of lectures attended will be displayed and no proxies are possible since the tracker 
   is supported by cloud capabilities. Even the security offered can be so robust and powerful that those students who always fool their deans are caught in a shorter span just after the admin enters login details into this tracker. All this 
   will improve accuracy and transparency in any of the educational institutions as students and their parents are pre-informed about the real-time status of leave requests and absenteeism in a confidential manner and at reduced costs.
